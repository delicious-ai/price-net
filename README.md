# Learnable Product-Price Attribution for Retail Shelf Images

This is the official implementation of "Learnable Product-Price Attribution for Retail Shelf Images", a novel approach to solving retail price attribution using neural networks.

## Getting Started

### Install Project Dependencies

`price-net` is managed via the `uv` package manager ([installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)). To install the dependencies, simply run `uv sync` from the root directory of the repository after cloning.

### Install Pre-Commit Hook

To install this repo's pre-commit hook with automatic linting and code quality checks, simply execute the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

When you commit new code, the pre-commit hook will run a series of scripts to standardize formatting and run code quality checks. Any issues must be resolved for the commit to go through. If you need to bypass the linters for a specific commit, add the `--no-verify` flag to your git commit command.

## Development

### Managing Dependencies

To add a new dependency to the project, run `uv add <package-name>`. This will install the dependency into uv's managed .venv and automatically update the `pyproject.toml` file and the `uv.lock` file, ensuring that the dependency is available for all users of the project who run `uv sync`.

To remove a dependency, run `uv remove <package-name>`. This will perform the reverse of `uv add` (including updating the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files).

See [uv's documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) for more details.
